## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Surprise Me from Long-Press Now Works Correctly

**Problem**: Long-press quick action for "Surprise Me" was opening the wrong sheet (Interactive Pairing Sheet for "Pair This Item" instead of the regular Pairing Sheet with Surprise Me mode).

**Root Cause**: 
- `wardrobe_quick_actions.dart` was calling `showInteractivePairingSheet` for "Surprise Me"
- Should have been calling `showWardrobePairingSheet` with `PairingMode.surpriseMe`

**Fix**:
```dart
// Before
onTap: () => _navigateToInteractivePairing(),  // Wrong!

// After
onTap: () => _navigateToPairingWithMode(PairingMode.surpriseMe),  // Correct!
```

**Changes**:
- Renamed `_navigateToInteractivePairing()` → `_navigateToPairingInteractive()`
- Renamed `_navigateToPairing()` → `_navigateToPairingWithMode()`
- "Pair This Item" → uses `showInteractivePairingSheet` (user selects items)
- "Surprise Me" → uses `showWardrobePairingSheet` with `PairingMode.surpriseMe` (AI generates 5 looks)
- "Style by Location" → uses `showWardrobePairingSheet` with `PairingMode.styleByLocation`

**Result**: Surprise Me now correctly generates 5 outfits (3 tight, 2 loose) instead of showing the interactive pairing UI.

### 2. ✅ Fixed Scoring Inconsistency (52% vs 96%)

**Problem**: Same brown button-up shirt + blue jeans scored:
- 52% in "Pair This Item" mode
- 96% in "Surprise Me" mode
- User correctly noted this is "not consistent or trustworthy"

**Root Cause**:
- "Surprise Me" mode was using **FAKE** scores:
  ```dart
  final baseScore = isTight ? 0.8 : 0.6;  // 80-100% for tight, 60-80% for loose
  final randomVariation = random.nextDouble() * 0.2;
  final finalScore = (baseScore + randomVariation).clamp(0.0, 1.0);
  ```
- "Pair This Item" mode was using **REAL** compatibility scores from `getCompatibilityScore()`

**Fix**: Changed "Surprise Me" to calculate REAL compatibility scores:
```dart
// Calculate REAL compatibility score between items
double totalScore = 0.0;
int comparisons = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
  for (int j = i + 1; j < items.length; j++) {
    totalScore += _getCompatibilityScore(items[i], items[j]);
    comparisons++;
  }
}
final avgScore = comparisons > 0 ? totalScore / comparisons : 0.5;

// For tight pairings, use real score; for loose, add some variation
final finalScore = isTight ? avgScore : (avgScore * 0.85 + random.nextDouble() * 0.15);
```

**Result**: 
- Both modes now use the same compatibility calculation
- Scores are consistent across all pairing modes
- "Tight" pairings show exact compatibility
- "Loose" pairings add slight variation (85% of real score + 15% random) for diversity

### 3. ✅ Fixed Bottom Navbar (No Longer Squished)

**Problem**: Bottom navbar looked cramped and squished, not premium.

**Changes**:
1. **Increased margins**: `fromLTRB(16, 8, 16, 16)` → `fromLTRB(20, 12, 20, 20)`
2. **Better padding**: `symmetric(horizontal: 12, vertical: 14)` → `symmetric(horizontal: 8, vertical: 16)`
3. **Larger radius**: `28` → `30` for more elegant curves
4. **Better opacity**: `0.92` → `0.95` for clearer surface
5. **Refined shadows**: Adjusted blur and offset for better depth

**Result**: Navbar now has proper breathing room, doesn't feel cramped, and looks more premium and iOS-like.

## Testing Verification

### Test 1: Surprise Me from Long-Press
1. Long-press any item in closet
2. Tap "Surprise Me"
3. **Expected**: Opens pairing sheet with 5 outfit suggestions (3 tight, 2 loose)
4. **Previous**: Opened interactive selection sheet (wrong)

### Test 2: Scoring Consistency
1. Select brown button-up shirt
2. Try "Pair This Item" with blue jeans → note score
3. Try "Surprise Me" with same items → note score
4. **Expected**: Scores should be similar (within 5-10% for tight matches)
5. **Previous**: 52% vs 96% (wildly inconsistent)

### Test 3: Bottom Navbar
1. View any screen with bottom navigation
2. Check spacing above and around navbar
3. **Expected**: Proper margins, not touching screen edges, feels spacious
4. **Previous**: Cramped, squished appearance

## Technical Details

### Compatibility Scoring Algorithm
Both modes now use:
```dart
WardrobeItem.getCompatibilityScore(other) {
  score += _getColorHarmonyScore(other) * 0.4;     // 40% weight
  score += _getFormalityScore(other) * 0.3;        // 30% weight
  score += _getOccasionScore(other) * 0.2;         // 20% weight
  score += _getSeasonScore(other) * 0.1;           // 10% weight
  return score.clamp(0.0, 1.0);
}
```

For multi-item outfits, averages all pairwise scores.
