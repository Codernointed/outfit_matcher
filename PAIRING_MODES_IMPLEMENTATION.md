**User Experience:**
- User selects hero item

  - 2 "Loose" outfits (creative, bold, experimental)
- Shows reasoning for each pairing
- Displays mannequin previews (Gemini API integration)

**Actions Available:**
- **"Save this look"** - Saves outfit to wardrobe looks
- **"View mannequin preview"** / **"Generate mannequin preview"**
- **"Shuffle more ideas"** - Generates new set of 5 outfits

**Note:** The "Give me another" and "Add a twist" buttons mentioned in requirements would need to be added to replace the current "Shuffle more ideas" button. This is a simple UI change in the `_buildActions` method.
