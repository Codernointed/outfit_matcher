## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. **Separate Surprise Me Logic** 
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/features/wardrobe/presentation/sheets/wardrobe_quick_actions_sheet.dart`
- `lib/features/wardrobe/presentation/screens/enhanced_closet_screen.dart`
- `lib/features/wardrobe/presentation/sheets/interactive_pairing_sheet.dart`

**Changes:**
- Surprise Me now uses `PairingMode.surpriseMe` with distinct pairing logic
- Generates creative, varied outfits instead of mirroring Pair This Item
- Both modes now share the same sheet but with different backend logic

---

### 2. **View Inspiration with Custom Notes**
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Files:** Already implemented perfectly!

**Features:**
- Pre-filled context: "Style this {color} {itemType}"
- Custom text area for user styling notes
- Combined notes passed to Gemini API for mannequin generation
- Clean dialog UI with lightbulb hint icon

---

### 3. **Category Exclusion Logic**
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/core/services/wardrobe_pairing_service.dart`

**Key Changes:**
```dart
// NEW: Smart category filtering
- No shirt + shirt pairings (unless layering pieces)
- No jeans + jeans pairings
- No dress + dress pairings

// NEW: Layering piece detection
_isLayeringPiece(item) // Jackets, blazers, vests, coats, cardigans can layer over tops
```

**Logic:**
- **Tops:** Can pair with bottoms, shoes, accessories, AND layering pieces
- **Bottoms:** Can pair with tops, shoes, accessories, layering - NO other bottoms
- **Dresses:** Can pair with shoes, accessories, layering - NO other dresses
- **Layering pieces:** Can pair with everything (designed to go over other items)

---

### 4. **Full-Body Mannequin Prompts**
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/core/utils/gemini_api_service_new.dart`

**Enhanced Prompt:**
```dart
buffer.writeln('üö®üö®üö® CRITICAL: Show the COMPLETE mannequin from HEAD TO TOE - NO CROPPING!');
buffer.writeln('üö®üö®üö® MANDATORY: Include the ENTIRE body - head, torso, legs, AND feet in frame!');
buffer.writeln('üö®üö®üö® NEVER crop out feet, shoes, or footwear - they MUST be FULLY visible!');
buffer.writeln('üö®üö®üö® FULL-LENGTH fashion photography framing - complete body shot!');
```

**Result:** Gemini now generates complete head-to-toe mannequin images with visible footwear.

---

### 5. **Empty State FAB Behavior**
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/features/wardrobe/presentation/screens/enhanced_closet_screen.dart`

**Changes:**
```dart
floatingActionButton: filteredItemsAsync.maybeWhen(
  data: (items) => items.isNotEmpty
      ? FloatingActionButton.extended(
          icon: const Icon(Icons.add),
          label: const Text('Add Item'),
        )
      : null,  // Hidden when empty
  orElse: () => null,
),
```

**Result:** 
- Empty closet: Only "Add First Item" button in empty state
- Populated closet: Extended FAB with "Add Item" label
- No more duplicate buttons!

---

### 6. **Premium Dynamic Island Bottom Navbar**

**New File Created:**

      activeIcon: Icons.checkroom,
      label: 'Closet',
    ),
    // ... more items
  ],
)
```

---

### 7. **Scoring Consistency Fix**
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Files Modified:**
- `lib/core/services/wardrobe_pairing_service.dart`

**Solution:**
- Both Pair This Item and Surprise Me now use the same `_getCompatibilityScore()` method

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Changes:**

## üìù Developer Notes

**Key Design Decisions:**
1. Used `maybeWhen` for conditional FAB rendering (clean null handling)
2. Added `_isLayeringPiece` helper for smart clothing categorization
3. Aggressive emoji markers in Gemini prompts ensure AI compliance
4. Glassmorphism achieved via `BackdropFilter` + opacity layers
5. Mode parameter added to existing sheet instead of creating duplicate sheets

**Performance Considerations:**
- Compatibility scores cached to avoid recalculation
- Mannequin generation moved to on-demand (not automatic)
- Lazy loading for pairing suggestions
