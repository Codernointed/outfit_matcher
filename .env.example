# Environment Variables Setup Guide

## üîê API Key Security Setup

This project uses environment variables to securely store API keys. Follow these steps to set up your API keys:

### 1. Create the .env file
Copy the `.env` file to your local project directory:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Add your API keys
Edit the `.env` file and add your actual API keys:
```env
# Gemini API Key for AI clothing analysis and mannequin generation
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here

# Add other environment variables here as needed
# DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
# ANALYTICS_KEY=your_analytics_key_here
```

### 3. Get your Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Go to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the key and paste it in your `.env` file

### 4. Security Notes
- ‚úÖ The `.env` file is added to `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ API keys are never committed to version control
- ‚úÖ Each developer needs their own `.env` file
- ‚úÖ Never share your `.env` file with anyone

### 5. Environment Variables Used
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Required for clothing analysis and mannequin generation

### 6. Troubleshooting
If you get API errors:
1. Check that your `.env` file exists in the project root
2. Verify your API key is correct
3. Make sure you've enabled the Gemini API in your Google Cloud project
4. Check that flutter_dotenv is properly loaded in `main.dart`

### 7. For Team Development
When working with a team:
1. Share the `.env.example` file (which contains dummy values)
2. Each team member creates their own `.env` file
3. Never commit the actual `.env` file to the repository
