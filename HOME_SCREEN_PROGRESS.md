# üè† Home Screen Implementation Progress

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Foundation - COMPLETED

### What We Built

#### 1. **State Management Architecture** (`home_providers.dart`)
Created a comprehensive Riverpod-based state management system with:

**State Classes:**

- `RecentLooksState` - Handles saved outfits with favorite tracking
- `TodaysPicksState` - Manages Today/Tonight picks with tab switching
- `WardrobeSnapshotState` - Displays wardrobe preview with pagination

**Providers:**
- `quickIdeasProvider` - Static occasion cards (Casual, Work, Date, Party)
- `recentLooksProvider` - Loads recent saved outfits from storage
- `todaysPicksProvider` - Generates daily outfit suggestions
- `wardrobeSnapshotProvider` - Shows wardrobe preview (6 items)
- `homeThemeProvider` - Light/dark theme toggle
- `homeSearchHistoryProvider` - Recent search terms

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling with retry callbacks
- ‚úÖ Loading states for all sections
- ‚úÖ AppLogger integration for debugging
- ‚úÖ Reactive updates via Riverpod
- ‚úÖ Caching and refresh capabilities

#### 2. **Search Functionality** (`home_search_results_screen.dart`)
Built a complete search experience with:

**Features:**
- 3-tab interface (Items, Looks, Inspiration)
- Real-time search across wardrobe and saved outfits
- Empty states for each tab
- Item preview integration
- Search result counts in tab labels

**Search Capabilities:**

## üöÄ How to Continue

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **Test Current Providers** (15 mins)
   ```bash
   flutter run
   # Navigate to home screen
   # Check console for provider logs
   # Verify data loads correctly
   ```

2. **Start Phase 2: Quick Ideas** (1 day)
   - Update `_buildQuickActions` to consume provider
   - Add long-press gesture
   - Create Customize Mood sheet
   - Wire navigation to pairing sheet

3. **Move to Phase 3: Recent Generations** (1-2 days)
   - Update UI to use provider
   - Fix overflow issues
   - Add favorite/share actions
   - Create SavedLooksScreen

---

## üí° Key Design Decisions

1. **Riverpod over setState**: Chosen for better testability and reactive updates
2. **Modular Widgets**: Each section can be independently developed and tested
3. **Provider-per-Section**: Allows parallel development and easier debugging
4. **AppLogger Throughout**: Comprehensive logging for production debugging
5. **Graceful Degradation**: All sections handle empty/error states elegantly

---

## üìù Notes

- All providers are initialized on app start
- Search screen is fully functional and ready to use
- Theme toggle infrastructure is in place, needs UI integration
- Wardrobe pairing service integration is pending for Today's Picks
- All navigation hooks are defined but need wiring
