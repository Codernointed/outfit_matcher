# Swipe Closet Fixes Applied

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Empty Wardrobe Bug** - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Swipe planner showed "No items found" even though wardrobe had items.

**Root Cause**: The filtering logic was too strict - it was filtering by category first, then by occasion/mood/weather, which resulted in no matches.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `swipe_planner_providers.dart` to:
  1. Load ALL wardrobe items first
  2. Log total item count for debugging
  3. Try filtering with lenient approach (no category filter first)
  4. If filtered results < 2 items, fall back to ALL items
  5. Then categorize items into tops/bottoms/footwear/accessories
  6. Added comprehensive error handling with fallback to all items

**Result**: Now the swipe closet will always show your wardrobe items, with smart filtering when possible.

### 2. **Overflow Error (296px)** - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Swipe planner sheet had 296 pixels overflow on the bottom.

**Root Cause**: Content was in a fixed-height Column without scrolling capability.

**Solution Applied**:
- Wrapped the sheet in `DraggableScrollableSheet` with proper sizing:
  - `initialChildSize: 0.9` (90% of screen)
  - `minChildSize: 0.5` (can be dragged down to 50%)
  - `maxChildSize: 0.95` (can be dragged up to 95%)
- Added `SingleChildScrollView` with the scroll controller
- Set `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` on Column to prevent unnecessary expansion

**Result**: Sheet is now fully scrollable with no overflow errors.

### 3. **UI Too Cluttered** - IN PROGRESS 🔄
**Problem**: Header takes up almost half the page before wardrobe grid appears.

**Solution Planned**:
- Reduce header padding
- Make title smaller (titleLarge instead of headlineMedium)
- Remove subtitle
- Make action buttons more compact
- Simplify CTA button

**File to Update**: `lib/features/wardrobe/presentation/screens/enhanced_closet_screen.dart`
**Reference**: See `enhanced_closet_screen_minimal.dart` for the new implementation
