## 🔄 How They Work Together

### **Separate but Connected**
- **Flow 1** builds your wardrobe inventory
- **Flow 2** uses AI to create outfits (can reference your wardrobe)
- Both flows can save results for later use
- User can switch between modes based on their need

### **Navigation**
```
Home Screen
├── "My Closet" Tab → EnhancedClosetScreen (Flow 1)
│   └── Add Item → SimpleWardrobeUploadScreen
└── "Get Ideas" Button → UploadOptionsScreen (Flow 2)
    └── Generate → ItemDetailsScreen → EnhancedVisualSearchScreen
```

### **Data Integration**
- Wardrobe items from Flow 1 can be used in Flow 2 pairing suggestions
- Generated looks from Flow 2 can reference items in your closet
- Both use the same storage system but different interfaces
